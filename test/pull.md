The reward for work well done is the opportunity to do more.


This is chunk 2, which is code

    
    for(int i = 0; i < argc ; i++) {
        printf("%s\n", argv[i]);
    }
    

This is chunk 3, which is left aligned


<files>
 <name="/etc/passwd" perm="0600" />
 <name="/etc/quotd" />
</files>


This is file2, no chunk, plain text

humor.
